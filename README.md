# Calculator
A scientific calculator that solves advanced arithmetic problems seamlessly, while giving a unique yet nifty user experience.

Calculator is a full fledged Android app.

 ## Features
   * calculate with trigonometric functions like; sine, cosine, tangent and their respective inverse functions (among other scientific functions).
   * compute equations in radian or degree.
   * calculate equations, also, to fraction or exponents (43×10³) alternatively.

   In settings, users can:
   * choose between three calculation/computation format (plain, exponent or fraction).
   * disable/enable haptic feedback for calculator buttons.
   * choose to save history and error-calculations to history or not.
   * and of course, switch between dark and light themes or follow system.

 ## Developed with
   * [Jetpack Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset like; from local storage or over network.
   * [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For executing tasks asynchronously.
   * [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - A persistent local data storage.
   * [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) - Material 3 is the latest version of Google's open-source design system that helps you design and build beautiful, usable apps.
   * [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Android Jetpack Navigation components helps you implement navigation easily and provides many fine ways of communicating between fragments.
   * [Shared Preference](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) - An API that allows you store key-value data.
   * [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable and maintainable apps.
      - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/stateflow) - An observable state-holder that emits data stream to its collectors - updating the UI incessantly.
      - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
      - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
      - [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
